- [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homology) ; Etymology: From homo- +‎ -logy.; In mathematics, the term was first used in a topological sense by French polymath Henri Poincaré, in a sense close to what is now called a bordism. Thus, he thought of a homology as a relation between manifolds mapped into a reference manifold. Such manifolds form a homology when they form the boundary of a higher-dimensional manifold inside the reference manifold. Poincaré simplified his definition by considering only spaces that were simplicial complexes (that had a triangulation), and only objects in the space made up of simplices in the triangulation. Eventually, Poincaré's version was replaced by the more general singular homology, which is what mathematicians mean by homology.; In modern usage, the term homology often means homology group. Thus, X did Y by computing the homology of Z means X did Y by computing the homology groups of Z. More loosely, as used in homology in a space, the term corresponds to a singular homology group (group of singular homologies).; homology (plural homologies); A homologous relationship.; (topology) A theory associating a system of groups to each topological space.; (algebra) A certain system of groups associated to a chain complex.; (chemistry) The relationship between the elements in the same group of the periodic table, or between organic compounds in a homologous series.; (evolutionary theory) A correspondence of structures in two life forms with a common evolutionary origin, such as flippers and hands.; (genetics) The presence of the same series of bases in related genes.; Usage notes; Like many terms that start with a non-silent h but have emphasis on their second syllable, some people precede homology with an, others with a.; (evolutionary theory): For a discussion of the use of the term homology (and by association homologous) in biology, see: Patterson, Colin. "Homology in Classical and Molecular Biology." Molecular Biology and Evolution 5, no. 6 (November 1988): 603–625. http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/5/6/603.pdf (accessed 18 December 2009; archived 18 December 2009, http://www.webcitation.org/5m7rn4rCe ); (mathematics): When used attributively before the name of a topological space, as in homology n-sphere or homology manifold, the reference is to a space whose homology is the same as that of the space mentioned: an homology manifold, for example, is a space whose homology is that of some manifold.; (mathematics): In modern usage, the term is used to mean homology group. Thus, X did Y by computing the homology of Z means X did Y by computing the homology groups of Z. More loosely, as used in homology in a space, the term corresponds to a singular homology group (group of singular homologies).; Derived terms; cohomology; microhomology; Related terms; analogy; homologue; Translations; See also;  Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms on Wikipedia.Wikipedia;  Singular homology on Wikipedia.Wikipedia; References

Rough mereology is based on the notion of a part to a degree and thus falls in the province of part–based mereologies.; 2007, Achille C. Varzi, Antony Galton (second reader), Chapter 15: Spatial Reasoning and Ontology: Parts, Wholes, and Locations, Marco Aiello, Ian Pratt-Hartmann, Johan van Benthem (editors), Handbook of Spatial Logics, Springer, page 947,; Let us begin with mereology. This is often defined as the theory of the part-whole relation, but such a definition is misleading. It suggests that mereology has something to say about both parts and wholes, which is not true. As we shall see in Sec. 2, the notion of a whole goes beyond the conceptual resources of mereology and calls for topological concepts and principles of various sorts. By itself, mereology is best understood as the theory of the parthood relation, regardless of whether the second term of the relation may be said to qualify as a whole entity.; 2012, Guido Küng, Ontology and the Logistic Analysis of Language: An Enquiry into the Contemporary Views on Universals, Springer, Revised Edition, page 107,; In 1926 Tarski drew Leśniewski's attention to the similarity existing between his mereology and Whitehead's theory of events. […] In the United States, mereology is known as the “calculus of individuals” — a designation that is etymologically somewhat paradoxical, since the objects of mereology are anything but indivisible individua.; Usage notes; Sometimes, slightly misleadingly, defined as the theory of parts and their wholes, although, strictly speaking, it does not deal with the parts or wholes per se, but only with the relationship between them.; Derived terms; mereological; Translations; See also; mereotopology; meronymy

Especially:; (linguistics) The study of the internal structure of morphemes (words and their semantic building blocks).; There are many ways to show that word structure is different from phrase and sentence structure. We will mention two here. First, free constituent order in syntax is common cross-linguistically; many languages lack fixed order of the kind that one finds in English. In morphology, on the other hand, order is always fixed. There is no such thing as free morpheme order. Even languages with wildly free word order, such as the Pama-Nyungan (Australian) language Warlpiri (Simpson 1991), have a fixed order of morphemes within the word. Second, syntactic and morphological patterns can differ within the same language. For example, note the difference in English in the positioning of head and complement between syntax and morphology.; (biology) The study of the form and structure of animals and plants.; (geology) The study of the structure of rocks and landforms.; (countable) The form and structure of something.; (countable) A description of the form and structure of something.; Derived terms; Related terms; isomorph; morpheme; morphotactics; Translations; See also; Wikipedia article on morphology in linguistics.; Category:Linguistic morphology

The rationale is that the -ology form should be reserved for the "study of disease" sense and for the medical specialty that provides microscopy and other laboratory services (e.g., cytology, histology) to clinicians. This rationale drives similar usage preferences about etiology ("cause" sense versus "study of causes" sense), methodology ("methods" sense versus "study of methods" sense), and other -ology words.; Not all such natural usage can be purged gracefully, but the goal is to reserve the -ology form to its "study" sense when practical. Not all publications bother with this prescription, because most physicians don't do so in their own speech (and the context makes clear the sense intended).; Another limitation is that pathology (“illness”) has an adjectival form (pathologic), but the corresponding adjectival form of pathosis (pathotic) is idiomatically missing from English (defective declension), so pathologic is obligate for both senses ("diseased" and "related to the study of disease"); this likely helps keep the "illness" sense of pathology in natural use (as the readily retrieved noun counterpart to pathologic in the "diseased" sense).; Derived terms; Related terms; pathologic; pathological; pathobiology; pathophysiology; Translations; Further reading;  pathology on Wikipedia.Wikipedia; Anagrams: logopathy
